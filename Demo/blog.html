        <h2>Seeing with “fresh eyes” – A deeper nature experience</h2>
        <h5>Blog 1, Dec 20, 2022</h5>

        <p>I couldn’t explain it but it was as if I was seeing this place for the very first time. I saw bees moving frantically amongst the flowers. The colours were so incredibly vivid. Were these same flowers here yesterday? Had someone come in the middle of the night and changed everything? It felt like that. There were so many details I had never seen before. It was disconcerting and in a way, almost frightening. I was usually a very brisk, purposeful walker but now my pace slowed. I looked around. There was so much life. So much movement. I felt an emotion that wasn’t at all familiar to me in those days…. pure joy. I could feel it intensely in my body. I just wanted to bask in all this beauty. I had been asleep, dead and now, finally I was awake.

      <h2>Connecting to Care</h2>
      <h5>Blog 2, Dec 20, 2022</h5>

      <p>The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the root of the environmental crisis. Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well? Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.
        If you really have a deep connection with this place, it is likely that you might feel moved to do something. That’s obvious, right? We naturally and instinctively act to protect that which we care very deeply about.

      <h2>Society – The soil in which we grow</h2>
      <h5>Blog 3, Dec 20, 2022</h5>

      <p>In order for any plant to grow and flourish to its full potential, it needs the right conditions.

        The soil is all important. Everything grows in the soil. If the soil is good and you have the right amount of sunshine and water everything takes care of itself. Nature follows its own course. We don’t need to interfere. The tiny acorn grows into the majestic Oak tree.
            
        It is no different for human beings. In order for us to grow and flourish to our full potential, we need the right conditions. In our case, you could think of society as the soil in which we grow.</p>
